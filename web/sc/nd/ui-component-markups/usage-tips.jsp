    <h3><a href="#">Document Structure</a></h3>
	<div style="padding:4px;">
		<p>
          ColaboPad allows you to create books and pages just like their physical counterparts. You create
          a new book by clicking on the new book button on your rigt <img src="images/toolbar/participant/new-context.png"/>. Once you create a book, you can add pages to it.
          Pages are created from the new page button <img src="images/toolbar/context/new-doc.png"/>. There are a number of page templates you can use.
		</p>

    <h3><a href="#">Collaborating with others</a></h3>
	<div style="padding:4px;">
		<p>
          ColaboPad has full access control that allows you to grant read/write access to your pad either to all members of your
          room or only to an individual. To grant access to all members, right click on the book you wish to grant
          access to and select the pages you want to grant access to. To grant access to a specific person, right click on their name
          and select grant access.<br><br>
          Once someone has access, they can read your page and write if they have write access. All changes are propagated in real-time to all members with access to a page.<br><br>

          <span style="color:red">Note:</span> Make sure when you grant access, the people you are granting access to refresh their views for the changes to take effect.

	<h3><a href="#">Playing Games</a></h3>
	<div style="padding:4px;">
		<p>
        ColaboPad has 2 board games currently (Chess and Checkers), more would be added soon. To play Chess or Checkers,
        simply create a new page with the game board as the template, as illustrated below:
        <p>
            <img src="images/misc/new-page-menu.png"/>
        </p>

        <span style="color:red">note</span>: These games can only be played with other people (not computer), so you'll need to invite someone to play with.

	<h3><a href="#">Using widgets</a></h3>
	<div style="padding:4px;">
		<p>
        ColaboPad has a number of useful widgets such as a mathematical function plotter and a projectile motion simulator.
        More widgets are being added. Try the widget menu to experiment
        with some widgets:
        <p>
            <img src="images/misc/widget-menu.png"/>
        </p>
        The difference between widgets on a page and other elements is that the widgets typically have
        pop-up buttons when you hover over them. For instance you can only move widgets using the
        move button that pops-up. For elements that you draw such as circles and rectangles, use
        the toolbar to your right for manipulating (moving, rotating) them.
